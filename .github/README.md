## 🚨 Important Notice: Private Branch for Advanced Features

A new **private branch** exists that contains critical features including **user authentication** and advanced proprietary algorithms. This private branch represents the core of the application and is not part of the public open-source repository.

**Collaborators & Monetization:**  
If you are interested in contributing to these advanced features, collaborating on development, or discussing monetization opportunities, I am open to suggestions and partnership proposals! Please reach out directly via [GitHub](https://github.com/owgit), [my website](https://uygarduzgun.com), or create an issue to start a discussion.

Let's innovate together!
